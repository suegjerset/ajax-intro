We'll be using express to setup servers.  We will install express via npm and use AJAX (part of jquery)
Basic steps:
set up node/express
set up basics for html/js/jq project:
-create "server" folder with server.js
-add start script to package.json
-spin up server
-create "public" folder in "server" folder
-create "scripts and "vendors" folders in "public"
-create "index.html" in "public"
-create "client.js" in scripts
-place jquery-x-x-x.min.js in "vendors"
-in "server.js": set up express.static for server/public
-test in browser
-set up html+scripts as usual
set up a GET route on server
create a function to GET info from server
use an AJAX request in this function using the following pattern:
```
$.ajax({
    type: 'GET',
    url: 'URLFORGETROUTE'
}).then (function ( response ){
    CODE THAT RUNS IF SUCCESSFUL
    NOTE: response IS RESPONSE FROM SERVER
}).catch ( function( err ){
    CODE THAT RUNS IF UNSUCCESSFUL
    NOTE: err is the ERROR SENT FROM SERVER
    }) // end AJAX
